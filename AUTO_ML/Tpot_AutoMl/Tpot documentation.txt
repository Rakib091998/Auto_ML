2. The goal of TPOT is to automate the building of ML pipelines by combining a 
   flexible expression tree representation of pipelines with stochastic search 
   algorithms such as genetic programming.

3.Genetic Programming:
          *Selection: You have a population of possible solutions to a given problem
                     and a fitness function. At every iteration, you evaluate how to 
                     fit each solution with your fitness function.

          *Crossover: Then you select the fittest ones and perform crossover to create a
                       new population.

          *Mutation:  You take those children and mutate them with some random modification 
                      and repeat the process until you get the fittest or best solution.
